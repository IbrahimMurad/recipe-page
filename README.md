## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Table rows `<tr>` does not support borders, margin or padding. I use them with `<td>`.
- Using min-width and max-width is better for responsive designs.
- markers are not really customizable, it needs to be overridden by before to have full control.
